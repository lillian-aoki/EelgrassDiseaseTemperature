**Abstract**: Ocean warming endangers coastal ecosystems through increased risk of infectious disease, yet detection, surveillance, and forecasting of marine diseases remain limited. Eelgrass (*Zostera marina*) meadows provide essential coastal habitat and are vulnerable to a temperature-sensitive wasting disease caused by the protist *Labyrinthula zosterae*. We assessed wasting disease sensitivity to warming temperatures across a 3,500 km study range by combining long-term satellite remote sensing of ocean temperature with field surveys from 32 meadows along the Pacific coast of North America in 2019. Between 11 and 99% of plants were infected in individual meadows, with up to 35% of plant tissue damaged. Disease prevalence was 3x higher in locations with warm temperature anomalies in summer, indicating that the risk of wasting disease will increase with climate warming. Large-scale surveys were made possible for the first time by the Eelgrass Lesion Image Segmentation Application, an artificial intelligence system that quantifies eelgrass wasting disease 5000x faster and with comparable accuracy to a human expert. This study highlights the value of artificial intelligence in marine biological observing specifically for detecting widespread climate-driven disease outbreaks.

**Description**: This repository contains the data and code to support the analysis and data visualization in the paper.   
* Data: This folder contains files with eelgrass data from 2019 field surveys and sea surface temperatures retrieved and collated from NASA's PO.DAAC. Note, temperature records from in situ loggers are not included due to the file size.   
* Code: This folder contains code files for both data analysis and visualization.  
* Figures: This folder contains the low-resolution copies of data figures from the paper and supplemntal material.
