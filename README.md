Abstract: Ocean warming endangers coastal ecosystems through increased risk of infectious disease, yet detection, surveillance, and forecasting of underwater diseases remain limited. Eelgrass (Zostera marina) meadows provide essential coastal habitat and are vulnerable to a temperature-sensitive wasting disease (EWD) caused by the protist Labyrinthula zosterae. We assessed EWD sensitivity to warming temperatures across a 2,500 km study range by combining a high-resolution satellite dataset of ocean temperature with field surveys from 32 meadows across 23ยบ of latitude along the Pacific coast of North America in 2019. EWD infected up to 90% of plants and damaged up to 30% of plant tissue across the study range. Disease prevalence was 3x higher in locations with warm temperature anomalies in summer, indicating that the risk of EWD will increase with climate warming. Continental-scale surveys were made possible for the first time by the Eelgrass Lesion Image Segmentation Application, an artificial intelligence system that quantifies EWD 5000x faster and with comparable accuracy to a human expert. This study highlights the value of artificial intelligence in marine biological observing specifically for detecting widespread climate-driven disease outbreaks.
